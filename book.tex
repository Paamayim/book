\include{introduction}
\chapter{Recursion}
A central theme of this book is one of \textit{structure}. By that, we mean that a primary interest is describing
the structure of \textit{things} in a systematic way. One of the most elegant patterns of structure is that of
recursion: things described in terms of themselves. Most of the concepts in this book can be described thusly, so it
seems fitting that we study recursion itself as motivating introduction both to the \textit{kinds of things} this book
will be exploring, and furthermore as a strong foundation itself.\improvement{not a beautiful sentence}

\section{Introduction}
\fig{recursion/monalisa.jpg}{A picture of the Mona Lisa holding the same picture.}{0.75}
My first encounter with the idea of recursion was on the cover of comic book my father had lying around our library when
I was a boy. The cover featured the main character reading a copy of the comic book that \textit{I} was reading. Clearly
visible on the cover of his book was \textit{him reading the same book}. My eight-year-old mind wasn't entirely capable
of comprehending what was happening, and I spent a significant amount of my childhood wondering about how such a thing
could possibly make exist. Of course, the book could exist because the cover in the cover of the cover was so small that
the human eye couldn't possibly make it out, so the artist could stop drawing, his job being complete.\unsure{maybe
describe the mona lisa instead?}

This fact, of course, is merely one of pragmatics. With a powerful enough imagination, you realize that there is nothing
\textit{in principle} which stops progressively smaller copies of my comic book protagonist from reading his own book,
in a series which \textit{never ever stops}.

\section{Motivation}
Types give us a strong language to ensure we're talking about the things we want to be talking about. They stop us from
doing stupid and nonsensical things, like comparing \type{Human}s and \type{Apple}s. However, from the point of view
of the type system, all people are created equal--they are all completely interchangeable with one another. While this
might be nice from an idealistic perspective, our personal experience describes all too well how your boss and
significant other are \textit{very different} from one another, despite the fact that they are both of type
\type{Human}. While types give us the ability to distinguish between different kinds of things, the language of spaces
is that of the differences between members of the same type. While types tell us how things are the same, spaces tell us
\textit{how things are different}.\change{this is a little rambling}

Having a strong grasp of what spaces are (and how they can be manipulated) will bestow upon you the ability to
identify specific values of a given type, find common features between them which is invisible to the type system, and
consider possibilities that you have never seen before.


\section{A Gentle Introduction}
Consider a map of the Earth. Given a latitude and longitude, you can accurately describe any location on the planet. You
might not be marveling now, but humanity didn't figure out coordinate systems until around the 17th
century\footnote{Although there is some evidence of the ancient Greeks using something roughly isomorphic to coordinate
systems.}--several centuries after\unsure{write something here to tie that into context}. Latitude and longitude are
just numbers, relative to a starting point defined only by fiat (the equator and prime meridian, respectively). Thus, a
coordinate of the Earth is a value of type $\type{Number}^2$. The coordinate at the equator and prime meridian we will
label as "the origin" and arbitrarily say is \coord{0,0}.



$$\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[swap]{dr}{f} \cdr{i_1} & A + B \arrow[dashed]{d}{s} & \cdl{i_2} \arrow{dl}{g} B \\
\phantom{} & X &
\end{tikzcd}$$\change{this shouldn't be here}

\section{Vectors}
\section{Bases}
In our map example, the two coordinates we used to describe the space were latitude and longitude--more precisely, a
vector pointing along the north-south axis, \coord{0,1}, and one pointing along the west-east axis, \coord{1,0}.
However, this is simply a matter of convention, there is no reason we couldn't have used one along the
northwest-southeast axis, \coord{1,1}, and another along northeast-southwest, \coord{1,-1}. In fact, we could even use
one pointing north, \coord{0,1} and one pointing north-north-east, \coord{$\frac{1}{4}$,1}. As it turns out, for our
map example, any two vectors will satisfy\footnote{Conceptually, at least. Actually \textit{using} these systems would
be exceptionally frustrating, though possible in principle,} us as a coordinate-system, so long as they are not both
pointing in the same direction.  It does us no good to have two coordinates which are both north-south, because we wold
never be able to describe what "east" was.\todo{we need to talk about vectors before this}

The arbitrary vectors we choose as our coordinates form what is known as a \textit{basis}.

\defn{basis}{A basis of a space is a set of vectors which act as the coordinate system. A choice of basis is completely
arbitrary, though different bases will make salient different features of the space, as we will see later. In general,
an $n$-dimensional space requires a basis consisting of $n$ vectors.}

While the north and west vectors are arbitrary choices for the basis of our map, it turns out there is a good reason for
why we might choose them, which we will discuss later in the section on projections\todo{get the reference for
Spaces::Projections}.

\subsection{Color in RGB-space}
While the choice of a basis is arbitrary, different bases can show interesting features in the underlying space. To
drive home this point\improvement{diction, please.}, let us consider \textit{color-space}--the space of colors. As you
might imagine, in color-space, we can use coordinates to describe different colors. In fact, this is how computers
represent colors, so we can rest assured that we're not just making things up.

If you recall your early childhood education, there are three primary colors--colors which can't be made up of other
colors. In contrast, all other colors can be made by mixing the primary colors together in different proportions. This
should set off the mental bells in your mind: this is a perfect example of a space! In fact, our basis can simply be
these primary colors, with coordinates being a percentage between 0\% and 100\%, with 0\% meaning there is none of the
color present, and 100\% being as much as possible. In the additive color model (how lights form colors, rather than how
paint forms color), the three primary colors are \value{red}, \value{green} and \value{blue} (or RGB for short). Thus,
we shall describe our basis to be the three vectors:

\begin{align*}
    \value{red:}   & \qquad \coord{100,0,0} \\
    \value{green:} & \qquad \coord{0,100,0} \\
    \value{blue:}  & \qquad \coord{0,0,100}
\end{align*}

swag}}{0.25}

You'll notice that colors which look similar to one another are close to one another in RGB-space. This is a phenomenon
known as clustering--similar colors have nearby coordinates. We will study clustering in more detail later.
